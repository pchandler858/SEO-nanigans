## Description

"AccessibleSEO" - A live demo showcasing an optimized and accessible marketing agency website that follows HTML semantic standards, ensuring proper structure, logical element hierarchy, descriptive alt attributes for images, sequential heading attributes, and a concise, descriptive title for enhanced search engine optimization.

## These were the challenge requirements:

### User Story

```

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
